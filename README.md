# Liquid-Handler

Welcome to the github page for the SideKick liquid handler!

The Sidekick is a desktop liquid dispensing robot, compatible with standard SBS microplates designed for accessible laboratory automation. The Sidekick features an armature-based motion system and a fully 3D printed chassis to reduce overall mechanical complexity and build time, and accommodate user modification. Liquid dispensing is achieved by using four calibration-free solenoid driven positive displacement  pumps that deliver 10 microliter increments. Control is provided over a USB serial interface using a simple vocabulary of commands, implemented in the form of a short Micro Python program. At a total price of $710, the Sidekick offers laboratories an easy to build, easily maintained, open-source liquid handling system for both research and pedagogical introductions to lab automation. 


This project is at the end of the prototype phase, and has been submitted to HardwareX. Right now, if you'd like to get started with building, take a look at the assembly guide located in the "Supporting Documentation" folder. This currently covers the mechanical assembly, the wiring, and getting started with the SideKick's software.
