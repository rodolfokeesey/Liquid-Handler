# Liquid-Handler

Welcome to the github page for the SideKick liquid handler!

The Sidekick is a desktop liquid dispensing robot, compatible with standard SBS microplates designed for accessible laboratory automation. The Sidekick features an armature-based motion system and a fully 3D printed chassis to reduce overall mechanical complexity and build time, and accommodate user modification. Liquid dispensing is achieved by using four calibration-free solenoid driven positive displacement  pumps that deliver 10 microliter increments. Control is provided over a USB serial interface using a simple vocabulary of commands, implemented in the form of a short Micro Python program. At a total price of $710, the Sidekick offers laboratories an easy to build, easily maintained, open-source liquid handling system for both research and pedagogical introductions to lab automation. 


A complete description of the project and build instructions is available in R. Keesey, R, LeSeur, J. Schrier, “Sidekick: A Low-Cost Open-Source 3D Printed Liquid Dispensing Robot” _Hardware X_ 12, E00319 (2022) [doi:10.1016/j.ohx.2022.e00319](https://doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.ohx.2022.e00319)  

But if you don't want to read the paper, and just want to get started with building, take a look at the assembly guide located in the "Supporting Documentation" folder. This currently covers the mechanical assembly, the wiring, and getting started with the Sidekick's software.
